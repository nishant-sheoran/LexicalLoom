# LexicalLoom
*A curated repository dedicated to my journey through compiler design!*

## About
LexicalLoom serves as a structured compilation of my explorations in compiler design, covering key concepts like lexical analysis, parsing, and syntax transformations. This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly with new insights, refinements, and advanced topics as my understanding evolves.

### Current Labs
1. **Basic Flex Programs** – Introduction to lexical analysis with simple tokenization exercises.
2. **Lexical Analyzer** – Implementation of a lexical analyzer using FLEX.
3. **Calculator using FLEX & BISON** – A basic arithmetic expression evaluator.
4. **Left Recursion & Left Factoring** – Handling left recursion and factoring in grammars.

## Ongoing Enhancements
This repository is actively maintained, with regular updates introducing more advanced parsing techniques, optimizations, and compiler construction strategies. As the project progresses, additional concepts will be explored to deepen the understanding of compiler theory.

## Technologies Used
- **Lex & Yacc (FLEX & BISON)**
